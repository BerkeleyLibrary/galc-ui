# galc-ui

A UI for the UC Berkeley Library [Graphic Arts Loan Collection](https://galc.lib.berkeley.edu/).

## For developers

`galc-ui` is a [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/) library using [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for
state management, coded in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and built with
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

### Development environment

In production, the `galc-ui` app is a JavaScript library, built from the [`src`](src) directory,
that runs embedded in an HTML page. To simulate this environment, Vite provides a development server
that uses the dummy [`index.html`](index.html) page in the project root directory.

### Getting started

1. Ensure you have the following prerequisites:

   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

   On macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the simplest way to do this is:

   - `brew install node`
   - `brew install corepack`
   - `corepack enable`

2. Ensure that the [galc-api](https://github.com/BerkeleyLibrary/galc-api) back end is
   available and running on port 3000.

3. In the project root directory:
 
   1. install the dependencies:

      - `yarn install`

   2. start the Vite development server
   
      - `vite`
   
   3. in the browser, navigate to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

### Test

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev), Vite's integrated test framework.
Tests and code coverage are configured in [`vitest.config.ts`](vitest.config.ts).

- `yarn test` runs the tests
- `yarn coverage` runs the tests with coverage

Be aware that currently not all files are covered (uncomment `all: true` in 
`vitest.config.js` to see what files are not covered), but also that those
files that are covered have both line coverage and branch coverage.

Note that the line numbers reported as branch coverage failures by the 
underlying [IstanbulJS](https://github.com/istanbuljs) engine are not always
intuitive â€” the underlying problem is likely on the first line reported, but
the range of lines may not be correct. Typical bnranch coverage issues include:

- `if(obj)` checks that are never passed a `null` or `undefined` value
- equality checks with `!==` for objects (e.g. `URL`) that are never equal
  (in the case of `URL`, use `toString()`, instead)
- default values for function parameters that are never used (the parameter
  is always passed explicitly)

### Code style

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to check and enforce code style.
ESLint plugins and style rules are configured in [`.eslintrc.js`](.eslintrc.js).

- `yarn lint` runs the style checks
- `yarn lint --fix` fixes those style problems that can be fixed automatically
